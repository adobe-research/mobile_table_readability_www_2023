<tr><th scope="row">Carbon</th><td>naturally abundant non-metallic element that occurs in many inorganic and in all organic compounds. It exists freely as graphite and diamond and as a constituent of coal, limestone and petroleum. Carbon dioxide is produced when carbon containing compounds are burned. Carbon occurs in Earth's crust as carbonate rocks and the hydrocarbons in coal, petroleum and natural gas. The oceans contain large amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonates.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Carbon dioxide</th><td>most abundant of the greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide currently contributes to around 75 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. It is produced as a by-product of oil and gas production, burning fossil fuels and biomass. All animals, plants, fungl and microorganisms also produce carbon dioxide.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Food miles</th><td>measure reflecting the distance and mode of transport of food as it travels through the food value chain. This enables simple comparisons to be drawn between energy use and the level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with different food products.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Food value chain</th><td>series of processes starting from food production and ending with food consumption and encompasses the 'paddock to plate' concept.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Extension</th><td>agricultural extension is the function of providing knowledge in agronomic techniques and skills to agricultural communities in a systematic, participatory manner, with the objective of improving production and farm income. The objective of extension is to bring about positive behavioural changes among farmers through knowledge and skills transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Functional food</th><td>food or dietary components that may provide benefit beyond basic nutrition.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Germplasm</th><td>collection of genetic resources for an organism eg. seeds, sperm and eggs.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Greenhouse gas</th><td>greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere absorb and re-emit infrared radiation. The Kyoto Protocol lists six major greenhouse gases which vary in their relative warming effect. The six gases are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride.</td></tr>
