<tr><th scope="row">Absolute Dating</th><td>The process of determining a specific date (in years or some other unit of time) for an archaeological, geological or paleontological site or artifact.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Agglomerate</th><td>An indurated rock built of large angular rock fragments embedded in an ashy matrix and resulting from explosive volcanic activity. Occurs typically in volcanic vents.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Bedrock</th><td>Native consolidated rock underlying the loose rock or soil surface of the Earth.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Calcite</th><td>A mineral that is the crystalline form of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), showing trigonal symmetry and a great variety of mineral habits. It is one of the commonest of minerals in association with both igneous and sedimentary rocks.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Chalk</th><td>A soft, white, porous sedimentary rock, a form of limestone composed of calcite coccolith plates.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Erosion</th><td>The displacement of solids (sediment, soil, rock and other particles) usually by the agents of currents such as wind, water, or ice by downward or down-slope movement in response to gravity or by living organisms</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Fault</th><td>A discrete planar rock fracture which shows evidence of a displacement (the throw of the fault). A fault is a discrete surface.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Fossil</th><td>Any mineralized or otherwise preserved remains or traces (such as footprints) of animals, plants, or other once-living organisms.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Igneous Rock</th><td>A type of rock formed by solidification of cooled magma (molten rock), with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Indurated</th><td>Made hard (by heat or compaction).</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Limestone</th><td>A sedimentary rock composed largely of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate: CaCO<sub>3</sub>)</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Marble</th><td>A metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite. Marble is typically not foliated, although there are exceptions. Often banded with various colours and sometimes veined.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Pumice</th><td>A light-coloured, highly vesicular volcanic rock of very low density.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Quartzite</th><td>A compact, hard, very fine-grained white to creamy white rock which breaks into sharp angular fragments. Quartzite is always associated with other metamorphic rocks, while cemented sandstone is always associated with other sedimentary rocks.  </td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Shale</th><td>A fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock composed of mud that is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments (silt-sized particles) of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Topography</th><td>The arrangement of the natural and artificial physical features of an area.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Vein</th><td>A mineral filling of a fracture or other crack within a rock in a sheet-like or tabular shape.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Zircon</th><td>A zirconium silicate mineral belonging to the group of nesosilicates. Its corresponding chemical formula is ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>.</td></tr>
