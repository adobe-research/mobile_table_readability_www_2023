<tr><th scope="row">Check Smoke Detectors</th><td>If smoke detectors are out of batteries or are broken, they will not alert you if there is a fire.  This increases the chance of injury or death in event of a fire.</td><td>Smoke and carbon monoxide alarms should be tested every month, but it's especially important if you haven't inhabited the house for an extended period of time.  Test alarms by pressing the test button.  Replace any batteries that are dead or dying. Most smoke alarms require a nine volt battery.  Vacuum around the vents of smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms to remove any dust that has built up around the sensors</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Replace Furnace Filter</th><td>Your furnace filter cleans the air that is pumped into your home.  If the filter is dirty, then the air quality in your home suffers.</td><td>Basic fiberglass or paper filters typically need to be changed every one to two months, and electrostatic or HEPA filters need to be cleaned or changed every two to four months.  Be sure the furnace is turned off.  Remove the service panel. If you cannot find it, consult the manufacturer's guide.  Slide out the old filter. Filters are typically located near the fan inside the furnace.  Insert a new filter, then close up the service panel.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row"> Dust any ceiling fans</th><td>Dust on ceiling fans will be spun into the air you breathe when you turn on the fan.</td><td>You can use rubber bands to fasten paper towels or a cleaning wipe to a paint roller, which can then be rolled across the fan blades. If you don't have these materials you can use a broom to dust the blades of a ceiling fan.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row"> Clean the gutters</th><td>Cleaning out the gutters will help reduce the chances of your home incurring water damage due to clogged gutters and drains.</td><td>Secure a ladder in front of your gutters. If possible, have someone with you to hold the ladder in place.  Wear yard gloves to protect your hands.  Use a small hand trowel to scoop out leaves and mud. Scoop debris into a garbage bag.  Use a hose to clean the downspout.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Clean the garage and driveway</th><td>To ensure that any sidewalk salt is properly rinsed away since it can cause cracks and etches in the concrete.</td><td>Sweep the garage and the length of the driveway with a push broom. Then rinse the garage floor and driveway thoroughly using a hose.</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Clean the outside of windows</th><td>So your house appears clean and you can see out of your windows.</td><td>The outside of windows can be washed using a spray-on cleaning agent or cold, soapy water. For a two- or three-story house, it may be difficult or even unsafe to wipe down the windows. In this case, you may want to wash the windows using a hose, angled upward from the yard</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Check caulking and weather stripping</th><td>Deteriorated window caulk lets in cold air, leading to higher energy bills.</td><td>Clean the edges that are to be caulked. Scrape away old, peeling caulk or paint with a putty knife or flathead screwdriver.  Hold the caulk gun at a 45 degree angle around the entire window.  Apply the caulk in a continuous, straight stream to every joint in the window frame and to the joint where the wall and window frame meet.  Be sure that the caulk is adhering to both sides of the seams.</td></tr>
