<tr><th scope="row">Nothing happens when you power on the device OR The buttons do not light up. </th><td> Maybe the CPAP device is not plugged in properly or the outlet doesn't work. </td><td> Try plugging something else in the outletto make sure the outlet is working.  If other things work in the outlet, then double check that you are plugging the device in correctly.  Make sure the power cord is connected correctly to the power supply and the power supply cord is securely connected to the device’s power inlet. If the problem continues to occur, contact customer service. Return both the device and power supply  so we can determine if the problem is with the device or power supply. If you are using DC power, make sure your DC power cord and battery adaptor cable connections are secure and check your battery. It may need to be recharged or replaced. If the problem persists, check the DC cord’s fuse following the instructions supplied with your DC cord. The fuse may need to be replaced. If the problem still occurs, contact customer service or buy a new one. </td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">The device powers on, but no airflow occurs. </th><td>Probably a problem with the blower. </td><td>First, double check the device is powered correctly (step above). Now insert a pipe cleaner into the blower tube to clean it out and remove any blockage. Does the Home screen appears on the user interface? If so, press the Therapy button on top of the device to start airflow. If the airflow does not turn on, there may be a problem with your CPAP device. Contact customer service for assistance. </td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">The device’s display is erratic. </th><td>The device has been dropped or mishandled, or the device is in an area with high Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) emissions. </td><td>Unplug the device. Reapply power to the device. If the problem continues, relocate the device to an area with lower EMI emissions (away from electronic equipment such as cellular phones, cordless phones, computers, TVs, electronic games, hair dryers, etc.). If the problem still occurs, you may have broken your unit by dropping it. </td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">The Ramp up feature does not work when you press the Ramp button. </th><td>Your CPAP unit does not support the  Ramp feature, or your blower pressure is already set to the minimum setting. </td><td>If your unit does not support the Ramp feature and you desire to have this functionality, please purchase an upgraded unit. If your unit has enabled Ramp, but the feature still does not work, check the current pressure setting on the Therapy screen. If the therapy pressure is set to the minimum setting (7.0 cm H2O), or the Ramp starting pressure is the same as the therapy pressure, the Ramp feature will not work. Make sure that the ramp time setting is &gt;0 or it will also not work. </td></tr>

<tr><th scope="row">The airflow is too hot. </th><td>The air filters may be dirty. The device may be operating in direct sunlight or near a heater.  The air temperature may be set too high.  There may be electrical problems internally. </td><td>Replace the disposable ultra-fine air filter. See product catalog for ordering information. The CPAP device needs to be ventilated adequately to ensure that warm air is not contiously recycled. If the CPAP device is near bedding, curtains, or walls that could block the air intake vent on the exterior of the device, try moving the device. Also, ensure that the CPAP device is not stationed in direct sunlight or near other heating equipment such as home heating vents. If using the humidifier with the device, check the humidifier settings. Refer to the humidifier instructions to make sure the humidifier is working properly. If the problem continues, contact customer service. </td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">The airflow pressure is either too low or too high. </th><td>The device may be set to the wrong diameter tubing in the settings.  </td><td> Check what diameter tubing is being used with your device (22mm or 15mm).  Make sure that the tubing makes a tight seal with the contact points of the device.  Then open the settings menu on the CPAP device, go to Tube Diameter setting.  Make sure the Tubing diameter setting (22mm or 15mm) matches the tubing diameter that you are using.  </td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Tube Temperature is turned on in “Setup” screen but Heated Tubing is not warm. </th><td>The heating component is broken and needs to be replaced. </td><td>Please contact customer service to order a new part which may be covered under warrenty. </td></tr>
