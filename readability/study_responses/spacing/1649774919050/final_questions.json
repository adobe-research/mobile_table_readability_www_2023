If it was difficult to follow that or figure out what belonged to what field. The bus one was a bit of a mess since I had to keep scrolling up to figure out the bus number. Some of the tables didn’t seem to populate well (like the phone one I got wrong) since it didn’t scroll over to the right well.","format":"Just how readable it was at first glance. If I could understand what it was trying to show within the first few seconds generally I was happy with it. Sometimes the format was strange and too much info was crammed into a cell.","comments":"No real problems! On a couple that I skipped or got wrong I never saw the information about the iPhone or had a different answer in my head. The $5 bonus was great motivation though!","filename":"final_questions"}
