Also, table formatting significantly influenced task difficulty, especially with regard to being able to easily visualize and compare the data.","format":"I was more satisfied with tables that were well organized, with relevant and easy to understand categories for data. Also, I was less satisfied with tables that required scrolling to see all the data without keeping the data categories/titles on the screen. It was very easy to \"lose your place\" when trying to visualize and compare data on these more complex tables.","comments":"This was a fun and engaging task. Thank you for the opportunity to participate. ","filename":"final_questions"}
