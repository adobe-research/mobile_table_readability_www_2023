It was also difficult when there were the same answers for different groups but you had to find the right group. It was easy when things were laid out singly.  Or when things were grouped together by their likenesses and not differences. ","format":"If it was formatted so that I had to scroll a long time before I reached another section that was difficult.  I'd be satisfied when the tables were fairly even and the answers were laid out in a consistent manner. ","comments":"Yea I think that the question about what name appeared 3 times in a top 4 team was a trick.  I only saw one name that appeared twice, the kerri name. ","filename":"final_questions"}
