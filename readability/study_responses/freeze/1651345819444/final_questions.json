When the font was so large that I had to move around too much that was hard.  There was one table where I was supposed to see something on your 2011 and that one was impossible because it had like 2011 margin of error at the top but I couldn't really determine which number was for 2011.  So it seemed to be missing information and I'm not sure if that's because of the format that it was just gone.","format":"I did not like it when the font was so large that it made everything scroll off the screen.","comments":"Thank you this was an interesting exercise.","filename":"final_questions"}
