I preferred smaller text as I could see more of the table at once. Larger font sizing made navigating tables more difficult and frustrating.","format":"The ability to quickly scan for information correlated with my satisfaction with a table. Tables that also had the axes be in a fixed position while scrolling (like one of the route schedule questions) was also satisfying since I did not have to repeatedly scroll to keep track of a category.","comments":"No issues encountered, everything worked well. One suggestion would be to move the end of the task questions to a separate survey since using a physical keyboard is easier than typing on a phone.","filename":"final_questions"}
