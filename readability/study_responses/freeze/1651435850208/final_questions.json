The more difficult tasks were those in which too much information/characters were used for table entries and when the font was too big which required more back and forth on the screen to determine coordination.","format":"I was most satisfied when all columns of a table fit the screen and I only had to swipe down for navigation. I was most unsatisfied when the horizontal rows were too long, and when the fonts were too big since these required more swiping left/right and up/down.","comments":"No problems to mention.","filename":"final_questions"}
