For example, just finding out what an acronym stood for was very easy and quick. Having to compare multiple episodes/their air dates was more complex as I had to quickly process much more information and do it quickly. ","format":"I really liked when the table had small font sizes and alternating colors between the purple at white. That made it much easier for me to see all the information at once. I was very unsatisfied when the table format text was so large that I had to scroll constantly to see everything in a row or column. I much preferred smaller and more concise tables/fonts.
