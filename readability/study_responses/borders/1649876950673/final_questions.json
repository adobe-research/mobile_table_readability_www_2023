Also, when information was aligned so that it was in a logical order that made it visually easy to follow.","format":"A number of the tables were not mobile friendly, requiring you to move them with you finger left and right to view all the information.  This made it difficult at times to lookup information correctly.  While most of the tables made sense, it required extra time to find information simply due to the way some tables were presented.","comments":"I enjoyed the task and had fun looking up the information, challenging myself to do the best of my ability.","filename":"final_questions"}
