I only missed one question and that excludes me from the $5 bonus. A better bonus structure would be percentage based which scales up. For example if you get 50% correct you get $1, 75% $2.50, 90% $4, and 100% $5. To me that would be a more fair bonus structure. After I missed the answer that I did I contemplated skipping the rest or returning the HIT, however for the sake of the research and what I consider to be fair, the base rate of $8, I decided to carry on.","filename":"final_questions"}
