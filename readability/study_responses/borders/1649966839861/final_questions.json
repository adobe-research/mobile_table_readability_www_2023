Satisfying formats were clean and easy to parse.","comments":"More than half of the tasks loaded horribly slowly, making the survey take much, much longer than it should've. Several times tasks would not load at all until I refreshed the page. By the end they finally started loading normally again.\nOther sites seemed to load normally when I tried, so I do not think this was an issue with my internet connection.","filename":"final_questions"}
