The two questions I missed presented the information in jumbled ways such that the table was useless for answering the question. You had to read through a tangle of arbitrarily presented information to find a fact, with the table presenting a hindrance rather than a help.","format":"In part how easy it was to see. In part whether it was properly labeled. I disliked the phone ones because the categories were unclear. In part whether they were helpful. In at least three cases, the table was utterly worthless.","comments":"The Olympic one stumped me due to how incredibly badly the info was presented, but I thought I got the last one right.","filename":"final_questions"}
