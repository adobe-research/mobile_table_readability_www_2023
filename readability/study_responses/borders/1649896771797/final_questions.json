It's very much like early tables in HTML, which I'm pretty sure is depreciated in favor of doing with CSS.","comments":"No issues, but it felt like a couple of questions were not very fair. I know nothing about wine, so even though some of the information was there, I couldn't tell you difference between a chardonnay and a sparkling.","filename":"final_questions"}
